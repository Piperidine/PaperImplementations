# DEEP LEARNING PAPERS

- This repository contains implementations of various Deep learning papers
- Models have been trained for a little time and will give better results if trained more. The focus was more on understanding rather than results
- An index of papers implemented along with the citations and URLs are as follows
> Note: Code in PyTorch
